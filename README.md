# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
My first project for [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity](https://br.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

This project is based on the source code from [ud036_StarterCode](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode), where we build a simple Movie Trailer website, containing a list of some of my favorites movies with their trailers.

# About the project
This project is basically composed by 3 python files:
- **media.py:** for our movie class
- **entertainment_center.py:** movie objects instances and finally
- **fresh_tomatoes.py:** provided by Udacity, which builds up our Movie Trailer website.

# Running the project
You can run this project by cloning or downloading it. You may need Python 2.x installed, then you can move to the project folder and run the command below: 
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
